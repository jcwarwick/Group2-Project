# Group2-Project
in the project our group of devs worked to make a place to store your thoughts feelings and ratings of diffrent films and tv series as well as save where you streamed them so you never forget when you recomend your favorites to your friends. We showed alot of great team work problem solving and ability to work with new and old file types frame works and Apis such as 

-Html
-CSS
-JS
-Tailwind CSS
-Rapid Api
-OMDb Api
and all the html css and java script commands to get a functional project within a 2 week span. 

when you first open the site you are on the home landing page from there you can either select the button that takes you to the movie search and review page, select the have a drink tab and find a random cocktail for your movie night, or go to the oh I've seen that page where you can go and see all the movies youve reviewed on the sight.
